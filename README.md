# Compression
This project implements Huffman encoding, a lossless data compression algorithm. 
It reads the content of a text file, builds a Huffman tree based on the frequencies of characters in the file, and generates Huffman codes for each character. 
The encoded message is then written to a compressed file. The program also calculates the compression ratio achieved by Huffman encoding.
